# Gmail Email Processing App

This Python script integrates with the Gmail API to fetch emails from your inbox, store them in a SQLite database, apply rule-based operations on the emails, and perform actions based on the rules defined in a JSON file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" page.
   - Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type.
   - Download the credentials JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in the project directory.

4. Set up the `rules.json` file:
   - Create a `rules.json` file in the project directory.
   - Define rules in the JSON format (see sample `rules.json` file for reference).

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python script.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate with your Gmail account.

3. The script will fetch emails from your inbox, store them in the `emails.db` SQLite database, apply rules defined in `rules.json`, and perform actions on the emails based on the rules.

## Test Cases

- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual functions in the script, such as authentication, fetching emails, storing emails, applying rules, and performing actions.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the entire application flow to ensure that emails are fetched, stored, and processed correctly according to the defined rules.

## Potential Issues

- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- **Authentication**: Handle authentication errors and token refresh failures effectively to prevent unauthorized access to Gmail.
- **Performance**: Optimize database operations and API requests to improve the performance of the application, especially when dealing with large volumes of emails.

Feel free to customize the README file according to your specific project requirements and implementation details. Additionally, ensure to include detailed instructions for setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials and defining rules in the `rules.json` file.
