# Gmail Email Processing App

This Python script integrates with the Gmail API to fetch emails from your inbox, store them in a SQLite database, apply rule-based operations on the emails, and perform actions based on the rules defined in a JSON file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" page.
   - Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
   - Choose "Desktop app" as the application type.
   - Download the credentials JSON file and save it as `credentials.json` in the project directory.

4. Set up the `rules.json` file:
   - Create a `rules.json` file in the project directory.
   - Define rules in the JSON format (see sample `rules.json` file for reference).

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python script.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate with your Gmail account.

3. The script will fetch emails from your inbox, store them in the `emails.db` SQLite database, apply rules defined in `rules.json`, and perform actions on the emails based on the rules.

## Test Cases

- **Unit Tests**: The unit tests are written in `tests.py`
1. `test_authentication`: This test verifies whether the authentication process with Google OAuth succeeds. It ensures that the authenticate_gmail() function returns non-null credentials, indicating successful authentication.

2. `test_fetch_emails`: This test checks whether the script can successfully fetch emails from the Gmail inbox. It verifies that the fetch_emails() function returns a non-empty list of messages, indicating that emails have been successfully retrieved.

3. `test_store_emails`: This test ensures that emails fetched from the Gmail inbox are correctly stored in the SQLite database. It verifies that after fetching emails and storing them using the store_emails() function, the number of emails stored in the database is greater than zero.

4. `test_load_rules`: This test validates the loading of rules from the rules.json file. It checks whether the load_rules() function successfully loads rules from the JSON file and ensures that at least one rule is loaded.

5. `test_apply_rules`: This test verifies the application of rules to the fetched emails. It applies rules loaded from the rules.json file to the stored emails and checks for any desired effects of rule application. Additional assertions can be added to validate specific actions performed by the rules.

## Potential Issues

- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- **Authentication**: Handle authentication errors and token refresh failures effectively to prevent unauthorized access to Gmail.
- **Performance**: Optimize database operations and API requests to improve the performance of the application, especially when dealing with large volumes of emails.

Feel free to customize the README file according to your specific project requirements and implementation details. Additionally, ensure to include detailed instructions for setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials and defining rules in the `rules.json` file.
